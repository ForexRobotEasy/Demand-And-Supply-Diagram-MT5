# Demand And Supply Diagram MT5

This code is a sample implementation of a demand and supply diagram for MetaTrader 5 (MT5). It analyzes the price and volume data to generate trading signals and identify market conditions such as excess demand, excess supply, no demand, and no supply. The code also includes functions for monitoring the sequence of signals, calculating the elasticity of demand/supply to the price, and displaying confirmation messages for buy and sell points.

## Input Variables

- `period` (default: 14): The period for price/volume analysis.

## Signal Generation

The `GenerateSignals` function is responsible for generating trading signals based on the price and volume values. You can implement your own logic in this function. It should return `true` if a signal is generated and `false` otherwise.

## Excess Demand and Excess Supply

The `IsExcessDemand` and `IsExcessSupply` functions detect excess demand and excess supply based on the price and volume values. You can implement your own logic in these functions. They should return `true` if there is excess demand/supply and `false` otherwise.

## No Demand and No Supply

The `IsNoDemand` and `IsNoSupply` functions identify no demand and no supply based on the price and volume values. You can implement your own logic in these functions. They should return `true` if there is no demand/supply and `false` otherwise.

## Warning Messages

The `DisplaySellArea` and `DisplayBuyArea` functions are responsible for displaying warning messages for the 'Sell area' and 'Buy area' respectively. You can implement your own logic in these functions.

## Signal Sequence Monitoring

The `IsSignalSequenceValid` function checks the sequence of signals and determines if it is valid. You can implement your own logic in this function. It should return `true` if the sequence is valid and `false` otherwise.

## Elasticity Calculation

The `CalculateElasticity` function calculates the elasticity of demand/supply to the price. You can implement your own logic in this function. It should return the calculated elasticity value.

## Confirmation Messages

The `DisplayConfirmationMessage` function displays a confirmation message for buy and sell points. If the `isBuyPoint` parameter is `true`, it will display 'Buy point', otherwise it will display 'Sell point'. You can implement your own logic in this function.

## Customization

The `CustomizeInputs` function is responsible for customizing the input variables. You can implement your own logic in this function.

## Expert Functions

The expert functions `OnInit`, `OnDeinit`, and `OnTick` are the entry points for the expert advisor. The `OnInit` function is called during initialization and can be used for customization. The `OnDeinit` function is called during deinitialization and can be used for cleanup tasks. The `OnTick` function is called on each tick and is where the main trading logic is implemented.

## Product Description

This code serves as a sample implementation of a demand and supply diagram for MetaTrader 5 (MT5). It analyzes price and volume data to generate trading signals and identify market conditions such as excess demand, excess supply, no demand, and no supply.

By using this code, traders can enhance their forex trading success by utilizing the principles of supply and demand analysis. The code provides customizable input variables and allows traders to implement their own logic for generating signals, detecting market conditions, monitoring signal sequences, calculating elasticity, and displaying confirmation messages.
